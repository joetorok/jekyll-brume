So we've slowed things down a bit. Far be it from me to complain, as I have yet to really grasp some of the syntactic maneuvers of coding arrays. But I'm interested in exploring a bit how this slowing down feels compared to the brisk pace we had been experiencing the first few weeks.

In the first few weeks, I felt as if I was awash in the coding lessons, I felt immersed in the practice, overwhelmed but also driven. This created a kind of acute anxiety that produced both a sense of debilitation as well as production. Rapidly approaching deadlines have that effect in general, but it felt even more irritative combined with the steep curve of learning something new. [Todd](http://tbreijak.github.io/blog/2016-02-03/How-Coding-Makes-Me-Feel.html) gets at this in his post about how discombobulated some of this makes him. And [Aden](http://adenj86.github.io/blog/2016-02-03/Second-Lab-Post.html), too, discusses a similar oscillation between despair and accomplishment.

In this past week, I've felt a bit of relief with the slower pace of coding. And that's great and all, but I'm now feeling a different breed of slower-creeping dread, perhaps not unlike the specter from [It Follows](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt3235888/). I'm not sure I enjoy this feeling any more than the pace in our first few weeks of [Fury Road](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1392190/) coding. I will need to watch for flying objects in seminar after saying this, but I think I prefer the more intensive, immersive pace of the first few weeks. //ducks//

In other words, I've put off coding a bit, or at least not engaged it as intensely as I have in the first few weeks. Some of that could be from finding a semester-rhythm that has settled into what a dull realization of what is possible with the commitments I have. But some of it also come from, I think, a shift in how a new pace has shifted my expectations. I sense a connection to our discussions of techno-determinism here, but perhaps I'll explore that in future posts on practice.
