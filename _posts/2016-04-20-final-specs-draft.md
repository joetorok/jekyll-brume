title: Final Project Specs Draft
categories: specs
---
I'm working on a Twitter bot speculative design project. I'll paste the draft of my specs below (along with a link to a Google Doc that can be commented on). But I'll link here to the bot-in-progress: [@SadPrinceAdam](https://twitter.com/SadPrinceAdam). As of this posting, my He-Meh bot is set to (sullenly) reflect on a year of his childhood every four hours. I'm working through what else I might have the bot do or how it might interact with others on Twitter,  but for now it seems to be up and running (Yay!) -- the bot should post again within the hour (the third tweet total, started the four-hour automation around noon today), so I'm keeping my fingers crossed!

Below is a draft of the specs, and here they are in a [Google Doc that allows comments](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ta5JzH8lcscz2KdMwrV5mdSdt5HqH9_KTW81YEtJAnE/edit?usp=sharing)

Analytical Prototype Specs: Twitter Bot

1) Results
- Approximately 300-500 words (+/- 20%)
- Link to a twitter bot
- Description of the process of making the Twitter bot

Rationale
* Approximately 1,000 words (+/- 20%)
* Reference at least two authors we have read in class
* Articulate the humanistic and/or aesthetic problems towards which the prototype is oriented
* Describe how the project is motivated: Why use the specific parameters that I use in the bot? Is the bot working aesthetically? Rhetorically? In some other way?  To what end?
* Specify what I have learned in the process of making the project.

Variation
* Approximately 1,000 words (+/- 20%)
* Reference at least four authors we have read in class
* Explore how changing the the parameters of the Twitter bot would change its effects. Describe 3-5 variations which would produce different effects. How would the bot change with different parameters oriented toward different ends?
